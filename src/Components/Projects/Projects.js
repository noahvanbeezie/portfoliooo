The biggest challenge I faced in this project was setting up the game engine, and this helped me build upon my understandings of basic logic-gates and conditional rendering.</p>

                                            It was created using:
                                            JavaScript, React, NodeJS, React Redux, Axios,
                                            PostgreSQL, and SocketIO

                                            This App is a hosting site for Board-Games, and the games we were able to complete within the two week time frame were Chess and Tic-Tac-Toe.

                                            My primary contribution to the group project was learning how to use Socket.IO, and how to integrate it into our app to allow multiplayer play.

                                            One of the major challenges that presented itself during this group project was that it was completed from home, as Covid-19 created a situation where we were no longer able to attend class. This proved challenging initially, but was a great experience in learning how to communicate each others tasks and goals for the day.
